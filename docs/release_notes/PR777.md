### Minor Updates

- Changes related to tasks, projects, and events. Issue [#760](https://github.com/semanticarts/gist/issues/760).
  - Renamed `gist:TaskExecution`, `gist:ScheduledTaskExecution`, and `gist:ProjectExecution` to `gist:Task`, `gist:ScheduledTask`, and `gist:Project`, respectively.
  - These classes are no longer limited to the execution of a task or project, but include proposed and planned events.
  - Removed datetime restrictions on `gist:Event`.
  - Replaced `gist:PlannedEvent` with `gist:ScheduledEvent`.
  - Added `skos:scopeNote`s and `skos:example`s to clarify meaning and usage.
