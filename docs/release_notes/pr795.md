### Patch Updates

- Modifications to pre-commit hook. Issues [#794](https://github.com/semanticarts/gist/issues/794) and [#795](https://github.com/semanticarts/gist/issues/795).
  - Modified the serialize pre-commit hook so it:
    - Makes sure the script starts in the root directory of the repository
    - Adds file to the commit after the sed command
    - Preserves file permissions during processing steps
  - Added new "root" pre-commit hook which:
    - Prevents commits to these branches: develop, main, master
    - Then runs the serializer pre-commit hook
  - Added a setup.cmd file to install the pre-commit hook into the .git/hooks directory. This script will work on Mac, Linux, and Windows.
  - Updated user documentation to reflect these changes.
