### Patch Updates

* Upgraded to version 1.14.2 of the [EDM RDF serializer](https://github.com/edmcouncil/rdf-toolkit) which is applied in a pre-commit hook during development. This removes `owl:NamedIndividual` assertions on instances defined by gist, such as `gist:_second`. Issue [#774](https://github.com/semanticarts/gist/issues/774).
