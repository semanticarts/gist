# Unit of Measure data migration queries

Follow the guidance in the slide deck uomDataMigration.pptx in the migration/v13.0 directory.

There is a set of queries to explore the existing data, and other queries to perform the migration.

Most of the data migration queries have to be customized per-Enterprise. 

Since the conversion steps are rather extensive, you might want to run them in stages.

If desired, you can create a yaml file for each stage of your data migraion (using the existing yaml files for non-uom files as a guide).

The data migration queries are all designed to migrate data in named graphs; modify the queries as needed to make changes in the default graph.
