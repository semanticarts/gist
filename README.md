# About gist

gist is Semantic Arts' minimalist upper ontology for the enterprise. It is designed to have the maximum coverage of typical business ontology concepts with the fewest number of primitives and the least amount of ambiguity.

We have an active governance and best practices community around gist called the gist Council, with a teleconference on the first Thursday of every month, where practitioners and users of gist come together to discuss how to use gist and make suggestions on its evolution.  Please send email to [GistCouncil@semanticarts.com](mailto:GistCouncil@semanticarts.com) if you would like to become involved.

You can also contribute to gist by adding your comments to [issue discussion threads](https://github.com/semanticarts/gist/issues) and submitting new issues and pull requests (see [guidelines for issues and PRs](https://github.com/semanticarts/gist/blob/master/docs/Contributing.md)). You can view [minutes](https://github.com/semanticarts/gist/wiki/gist-Development-Team-Meeting-Notes) from our bi-monthly review sessions to find out what we've been discussing and get a preview of upcoming changes to gist.

In addition to the conditions of this license, we require that any concepts used from gist remain in the gist namespace, and that you do not define your own term definitions in the gist namespace.
