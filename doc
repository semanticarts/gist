Release notes gist 9.0.0
--------------------------
### General
*	The `gist` namespace has been modfied from `http:` to `https:`.
*	Added comments to ontologies.
*	Added labels and comments to many properties and classes.
*	`SocialBeing` has been removed.  
*	The property `gist:party` has been renamed to `gist:hasParty`.

Import URL: http://ontologies.semanticarts.com/o/gistCore9.0.0

### Agreement
* `SocialBeing` has been removed. A few restrictions that used `SocialBeing` as a filter class now use the expression `(Person or Organization)`
* Added `Contract`
* The property `gist:party` was renamed to `gist:hasParty`

### Category
* New property: `hasTag`.
* A `gist:Category` now uses `gist:hasTag` instead of `gist:containedText`. 
* The definition of `Taxonomy` was corrected. It used to be a controlled vocabulary that had a super category or a navigational parent. But it is not the taxonomy that is part of a hierarchy, it is the elements of the taxonomy that are part of the hierarchy.  The definition for `gist:Taxonomy` now says it is a controlled vocabulary and has a member that has either  a sub category or super category.  The notion of navigational parent is no longer included in the definition.
* The object property `gist:hasPreferredTerm` that pointed to a `gist:Text` property was removed. Use the annotation `skos:prefLabel` instead.

### Event
* Renamed `occurredAt` to `occursAt`.
* Changed restriction on `gist:Event` to be `(occursAt gist:Place)` rather than `(occuredAt gist:GeoRegion)`.
* Renamed `TemplateTask` to `TaskTemplate` because it is a template related to tasks, not a task related to templates. 
* Moved `gist;characterizedAs` to gistTop.
* Removed `TimeInterval`. A number of restrictions with filter class `(TimeInstant or TimeInterval)` changed to be just `TimeInstant`.

### Intention
* A `ServiceSpecifictation` no longer produced a behavior. Rather, it is the basis for an `Event` (replaced a restriction)
* New property: `basisFor`, inverse of `basedOn` which is defined in gistTop.

### IoT
Entirely new ontology for modeling Internet of Things concepts.

### Measure
* Slight clarification of the meaning of OrdinalCollection.  Mathematically, it is more than just a total order, it is a strict total order.
* `directlyPrecedes`      replaces `strictlyPrecedes`.
* `directlyPrecededBy` replaces `strictlyPrecededBy`
* `PhysicalThing` removed, was  a vestige from the past.

### Network
* Entirely new ontology covering concepts for a virtual or actual network.

### Organization
* New Class:  `GeoPoliticalRegion`, a collection of `gist:GeoRegion` administered by a `GovernmentOrganization`

### Place
* The range of the property `geoOccupies` changed to `gist:Place`. It had been the union of `GeoRegion` and `GeoVolume`.

### TemporalRelation
* `TemporalRelation` no longer a subclass of `TimeInterval` (which has been removed).

### Time
* Just a few new labels and comments.

### Top
* References to `TimeInterval` removed.
* `Event` is no longer a subclass of `TimeInterval`. Instead, it has a start and end time.
* `gist:Content` is no longer disjoint with `Intention`.
* `gist:Magnitude` is no longer `gist:of` something.   We used to think of magnitude of say 180 pounds as necessarily being a value associated with something, e.g. a person.  `gist:of` was the inverse of `gist:hasA` which no longer exists.

### Unit
* `RatioUnit` used to have exactly 1 `UnitOfMeasure` as a numerator, now it can have more than one.

### Deprecated
Added to the list of deprecated things:
1.	Renamed
a.	`gist:TemplateTask` (renamed to `TaskTemplate`)
b.	`gist:party` (use `hasParty` instead)
2.	Removed
a.	`gist:SocialBeing`  - use `(Person or Organization)` instead
b.	`gist:of` (a vestige of the past) 
c.	`gist:sameOrderAs` (was adding unnecessary mathematical precision)
d.	`gist:TimeInterval` (the idea of a time interval is captured by assigning it a start and end time, e.g. an event) 
e.	`gist:dateTime`
3.	Replaced by a variation
a.	`gist:strictlyPrecededBy` (using `directlyPrecededBy` instead)
b.	`gist:strictlyPrecedes` (using `directlyPrecedes` instead) 

Release notes gist 8.0.0
--------------------------

This major version primarily changed all concept URIs to use `/` instead of `#`
Additionally, gistWiki is no longer included by gistCore.

Release notes gist 7.5
------------------------

This version focused on making the import structure simpler and flatter, in order to make it easier for people to use subsets of gist if they want to.  Because all of gist is in one name space this was relatively easy to do and will have very little impact on anyone who is using gist 7.* (see the change log there were a few changes that you may want to review)

Release notes gist 7.4
------------------------

Gist 7.4 was an internal release.

Release notes gist 7.3
------------------------
### General
* An additional supplementary ontology was added for Units of Measure which introduces the concept of a Coherent Unit. This allows for conversions between units of the same dimension to be done using just SPARQL, as opposed to relying on rules.
* There are new and/or improved annotations (definitions, notes, examples, negative examples, etc.) on all Classes. 
* The Category ontology added properties for true sub/super type relationship, including having a unique superType (parent).
* Other minor changes: 
  * removal of redundant imports and redundant classes already defined in another ontology 
  * relaxed the domain on gist:start and gist:end
  * expanded the range of gist:fromAgent and gist:toAgent
  * added to the Units of Measure ontology and corrected an erronoeously named class

See ChangeLog in pdf file for full details of changes.

Release notes gist 7.2
------------------------
* Add wiki and rdfshape capability
* Removed some redundant assertions, and moved some comments to the ontology where the concept was first introduced.
* Removed `currencyValue` in favor of `decimalValue`
* Upgrades domains on some date properties and `hasCommunicationAddress`
* Deprecated a lot of the measurement stuff that wasn't being used (as far as we know)

Release notes gist 7.1.1
------------------------
* Fix an erroneous disjoint statement on the class gist:Magnitude. 
If you previously downloaded gist 7.1 you may have experienced an inference error if you attempted to run inference using Hermit. 
The gist 7.1.1 release has eliminated the cause of this error. 
* In addition to using the OWL files locally, you can import these files via URL directly into your ontology editor of choice(Protegé, Topbraid, etc.) The import will take care of the dependencies.

Release notes gist 7.1
----------------------
Primarily fixes minor errors like typos in our gist 7.0 release. 

Below is a brief summary of the changes that have semantic import from an inference perspective (axiom added, removed, changed, etc.) or that are backward incompatible.

* Made `gist:uniqueText` a sub-property of `gist:containedText`.
* Added `gist:Agreement` to range of `gist:governs`.
* Changed `gist:prevent`, `gist:allow` and `gist:require` to `gist:prevents`, `gist:allows`, and `gist:requires`.
* Changed restriction on `gist:Offer` to use `gist:hasDirectPart some gist:CatalogItem`.
* Removed property `gist:specifiedIn`, no longer needed.
* Changed property restriction on `gist:Account` from `gist:hasA some gist:Balance` to `gist:hasMagnitude some gist:Balance`.
* Corrected inverse property of `gist:hasDirectSubtask` to `gist:directSubtaskOf`
* Added `gist:IntellectualProperty` and `gist:PhysicalThing` to the range of `gist:governs`.
* In the definition of `gist:Requirement`, removed `gist:Conformance` from the range of `gist:requires`.

In addition to using the OWL files locally, you can import these files via URL directly into your ontology editor of choice(Protegé, Topbraid, etc.) The import will take care of the dependencies.

Release Notes gist 7.0
----------------------

gist 7.0 is a major upgrade from our last released version (6.7.1). The main differences are:

* gist 7.0 is extremely modular. There are 18 modules that can be used collectively or in subsets if you don't need all the concepts in gist.
* gist 7.0 is more elegant than its predecessors. We have reduced the number of top level concepts that everything else derives from to 12. And these 12 concepts are not philosophical abstractions like endurants and perdurants, or qualia, there are normal terms whose definitions   are quite close to what you already believe.
* gist 7.0 has more extensive and more-fine grained disjointness at the highest level. It turns out that in order for an upper ontology to help you avoid making logical errors in your derived enterprise or application ontology, it needs to make use of disjointness. Without  disjointness, the reasoner does not find logic errors.

For documentation and OWL files regarding terms that were deprecated when moving from version 6.7.1 to 7.0, please see the sub-folder called "Deprecated terms from gist6.7.1" 

In addition to using the OWL files locally, you can import these files via URL directly into your ontology editor of choice(Protegé, Topbraid, etc.) The import will take care of the dependencies.
